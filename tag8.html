        The word essay derives from the French infinitive essayer, "to try" or "to attempt". 
        In English essay first meant "a trial" or "an attempt", and this is still an alternative meaning.
         The Frenchman Michel de Montaigne (1533â€“1592) was the first author to describe his work as essays; he used the term to characterize these as "attempts" to put his thoughts into writing.

        Subsequently, essay has been defined in a variety of ways. 
        One definition is a "prose composition with a focused subject of discussion" or a "long, systematic discourse".
        [3] It is difficult to define the genre into which essays fall. Aldous Huxley, a leading essayist, gives guidance on the subject.
        [4] He notes that "the essay is a literary device for saying almost everything about almost anything", and adds that "by tradition, almost by definition, the essay is a short piece". 
        Furthermore, Huxley argues that "essays belong to a literary species whose extreme variability can be studied most effectively within a three-poled frame of reference"</p>
